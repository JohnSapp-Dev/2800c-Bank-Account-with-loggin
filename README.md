# Bank Account Simulator
---
### This Java program allows the user to interact with a simulated banking system. The user must create an account with a username and password. If the user is a returning customer they can sign into their account with their credentials. 
### The program allows the user to
- Create an Account
- Sign into an Account
- View their checking and savings account balance
- Make withdraws from each account
- Make deposits to each account
### Upon signing out the program prompts the user to print a receipt. If the user chooses to, a text (.txt) file is created with a log of every transaction made during the interaction.
